Terms:
1. Dependency - A module being required by another program is often called a dependency.
2. Script - A script is the file being executed by the interpretor, which may import other files as modules


Module Notes:
1. A modules filename should always end with ".py"

12.7
CSV or Comma Seperated Values - Simple text based file format that use commas to seperate data items called fields
Fields - The values in each row of the CSV file seperated by commas
    Example:
    Name, Age, City
    Alice, 30, New York
    Bob, 25, Dallas
    Noye: In this example, "Name", "Age", and "City" are fields
CSV Module: Can be used to help read and write files in the csv format (example: grades_reader = csv.reader()).


13.1-13.3
Base: A class that can serve as the basis for another class is called a base class. Derived classes inherit fom base classes.
Inheritance Tree: Describes the heiarchy between base and derived classes
Note: A derived class inherits the attriubutes of the base class and then adds additional attributes. 

EX: 
class baseClassName:
    code

class childClassName(baseClassName):
    code that calls attributes from base class to use with new code here

override = display() - 'The purpose of the display() method is to provide a way to easily print out the relevant information about an Item or Produce object. This can be useful for debugging, testing, or displaying the object's data in a human-readable format.'

has-a and is-a 

mother object is has-a string object and has child objects but no inheritance is involved
has-a = composition
is-a - inheritance

A pear 'is a' kind of fruit. Pear does not 'have a' fruit, nor does fruit 'have a' pear.
pear/fruit is-a
house/door - has-a
